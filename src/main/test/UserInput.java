    /**
     This method obtains the next move from the next player and populates the from[] and to[] arrays accordingly.  These arrays should be of length at least 2.

     On exit, from[0] and from[1] store the x and y co-ordinate respectively of the piece to be moved.

     Similarly, to[0] and to[1] store the x and y co-ordinate respectively of the destination location.

     The x, y co-ordinates are in the range 0,0 (bottom left) to 7,7 (top right).  The same co-ordinate system is used for both players.

     The first time this function is called it returns the move for player 1 (whose  pieces occupy the positions 0,0 to 7,1).  It then returns moves for alternating players.

     This function returns false when there are no more moves.  Otherwise, it returns true.
